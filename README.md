# Presentation 

This repository contains the implementation of Perlin Noise algorithm for procedural generation using C++ and SDL2.

# How to use

To use it, simply type ```make ``` in a terminal, you wil need ```g++```. Then launch ```./application``` to launch the generation of an image,
with initial values. You can customize these variables by adding parameters in ```./application``` .    
Typing ```./application 10 5 4 ``` will use the Perlin Noise algorithm for a grid of size 10*10, with 5  subdivisions and 4 octaves, and display it on the screen.
